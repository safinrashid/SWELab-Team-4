# Checkpoint 1

## Project Summary and Plan

### User Management:

a. Create a sign-in page where users can enter their user name, user ID, and password.

b. Implement a "New User" functionality that displays a pop-up to enter a new user ID and password.

c. Develop a section for creating new projects, including fields for project name, description, and project ID.

d. Create a section where users can log in to existing projects.

e. Implement a database, MongoDB, to store user information and project details.

f. Create an API to access user and project information stored in the database.

g. Implement AES-256 to encrypt user IDs and passwords.


### Resource Management:

a. Develop a display area that shows the capacity of HWSet1 and HWSet2.

b. Create a display area that shows the availability of HWSet1 and HWSet2.

c. Implement a database to store hardware resource information.

d. Create a display area where users can specify how many units of HWSet1 and HWSet2 they want to check out and later check-in.


### System Requirements:

a. Ensure that the PoC is delivered within budget and schedule constraints, with periodic updates to stakeholders. Use an Agile development approach.

b. Develop a front-end web application using React.js that allows users to enter inputs and view outputs.

c. Implement AES-256 encryption for encrypting user IDs and passwords using Python cryptographic modules.

d. Develop a mechanism for creating new projects or accessing existing projects using Python object-oriented programming (OOP) and modules.

e. Create a database for maintaining user login credentials, project codes, project details, and resource details using MongoDB.

f. Map each system requirement to one or more stakeholder needs to ensure that all stakeholder needs are met.

## User Stories

We plan to use the built-in GitHub 'Project' tool in this repository to delegate work items effectively in one spot.
